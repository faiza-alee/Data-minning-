This repository demonstrates the implementation of neural networks using the MNIST dataset,which consists of handwritten digits. The project explores various architectures, 
including fully connected networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify the images effectively.It includes code for data preprocessing,model training,
and evaluation metrics.Dive into the examples to see how neural networks can achieve high accuracy in digit recognition and understand the fundamentals of deep learning.
